 * This fork was necessary to integrate with the F5Â® Distributed Cloud Defense Mobile SDK,
 * which protects API endpoints from automation attacks by collecting telemetry and adding
 * custom HTTP headers to requests. The response handling capability was built into the
 * ForgeRock SDK to ensure that the F5 Distributed Cloud Bot Defense Mobile SDK can inspect
 * and process response headers for its internal functionality.
